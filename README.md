\textbf{grafy} contains programms used to manipulating weights of graph. After initializing \textbf{nadawanie_wag} which is a bijection between set of nodes and list of weights you can ommit nodes with positive/negative weights and applying odbicie function (means reflection) using \textbf{omijanie_dodatnich / omijanie_ujemnych}. You can also use \textbf{zmiana_na_dodatnie/ zmiana_na_ujemne} to run odbicie function (reflection) until there will be any positive/negative weights.
