# Commutative-_Algebra: kombi
This notebook provides a collection of Python functions for performing advanced operations on graphs, especially those defined by weights assigned to nodes. It includes tools for constructing graphs, manipulating node weights, and analyzing their behavior under various transformations. Below is a summary of the main functionalities:

# Key Features
- Graph Construction (T_pqr):
Constructs specific types of graphs parameterized by ùëù,ùëû,ùëü
Supports the creation of connected graphs with weighted nodes and multiple structures (chains, branches).

- Symmetric and External Combinations of Lists:

  - symetryczna: Generates all symmetric combinations of sublists.
  - zewnetrzna: Generates external combinations using unique subsets of sublists.
  - zewnetrzna_num: Enumerates and prints externally combined results for debugging.
    
- Node Weight Operations:
  - nadawanie_wag: Assigns weights to nodes in the graph from a list.
  - odbicie: Reflects the weights of a node and its neighbors based on a custom rule.
  - Increment/Decrement node weights:
  - ro_1: Increases all weights by 1.
  - ro_2: Decreases all weights by 1.
-Recursive Weight Manipulation:
  - rownolegle and rownolegle_mod: Iteratively adjust weights, identifying unique patterns of positive/negative counts.
  - positive: Attempts to transform weights to non-negative values within a finite number of operations.
  - ushing_down: Applies predefined offsets to combinations of weights.
- Extremal Analysis (extremal):
Explores transformations of node weights to distinguish specific configurations.
Identifies unique patterns with constraints on an exception node.
# Applications
- Graph Analysis:
  - Study weight transformations under iterative operations.
  - Identify positive/negative orbits and their distinct characteristics.
- Optimization and Pattern Recognition:
  - Solve problems involving weight balancing or distribution on graphs.
  - Investigate extremal cases and their levels of distinction.
- Mathematical Modeling:
  - Model systems with specific constraints and transitions using weighted graphs.
