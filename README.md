# Commutative-_Algebra
This repository explores advanced graph theory and weight manipulation algorithms. It contains two comprehensive notebooks that delve into constructing and analyzing weighted graph structures, with an emphasis on their transformation and classification through specific operations. Below is an overview of both notebooks combined:

# Notebook 1: Graph Weight Manipulation and Iterative Transformations
- Graph Construction:
Implements the construction of 𝑇𝑝,𝑞,𝑟 graphs, parameterized by 𝑝, 𝑞 and 𝑟 representing special graph configurations with distinct node and edge patterns.

- Weight Operations:
  - Assign weights to graph nodes using various algorithms.
  - Perform iterative transformations like node reflections and incremental updates, which adjust weights based on node relationships.
  - Evaluate whether graph weights achieve desired conditions, such as non-negativity.
  - Symmetric and External Combinations:
  - Generate new weight configurations by summing combinations of existing weight lists symmetrically or asymmetrically.

# Algorithms for Weight Analysis:

- Positive Weight Search: Iteratively applies transformations to determine if a non-negative weight configuration can be achieved.
- Weight Partitioning: Classifies results into positive and negative orbits, offering insights into the dynamics of weight updates.
- Count-Based Classification: Differentiates weights based on even or odd iterations required to reach the desired state.

# Notebook 2: Extremal and Pushing-Down Methods
- Extremal Transformations:
Focuses on analyzing distinguished weights in graph structures. These algorithms examine whether certain weights remain negative except for a predefined exception.

- Iterative Orbit Exploration:
Tracks how weights evolve across multiple levels of transformations, identifying unique cases or patterns.

- Pushing-Down Method:
Augments generated weights (from symmetric combinations) by adding predefined lists, extending the scope of configurations explored.

# Real-World Applications:
The extremal transformations and weight partitioning algorithms provide tools for studying extremal graph behavior and distinguishing graph weight distributions.

# Key Features Across Both Notebooks:
- Dynamic Graph Transformations: Algorithms dynamically modify graphs to test specific hypotheses about weight configurations.
- Iterative Techniques: Both notebooks employ iteration limits and controlled branching to ensure computational feasibility.
- Comprehensive Output Analysis: Results are broken down into categorized partitions, offering insights into graph dynamics and symmetry properties.
- Scalability: Algorithms are designed to handle complex graph structures and weight configurations efficiently.
# Usage:
- Researchers and enthusiasts in graph theory can use these notebooks to explore weighted graph transformations, symmetry, and extremal configurations.
- Extendable framework for testing other graph structures or new weight manipulation strategies.
