# Commutative-Algebra- Grafy: Key Features
- Graph Construction - T_pqr
 \
Generates a customizable graph T_pqr based on input parameters ùëù, ùëû, and r.
Supports varying configurations depending on the values of ùëù,ùëû,ùëü
p,q,r, including edge connections and node weights.
- Weight Assignment - nadawanie_wag
Assigns weights to nodes in a graph using a provided list.
Ensures the graph nodes are initialized with custom weights for further operations.
-Weight Transformations:

 - Reflection - odbicie: Reflects weights of a node and updates its neighbors based on specific transformation rules.
 - Increment/Decrement - ro_1 and ro_2: Globally adjusts node weights by a fixed increment or decrement.
 - Iterative Weight Normalization
Procedures to transform all node weights to positive or negative values using iterative reflection:
- Positive Weight Normalization:
- - zmiana_na_dodatnie_obl: Iteratively adjusts negative weights without sorting.
- - zmiana_na_dodatnie: Prioritizes nodes with the smallest weights.
- Negative Weight Normalization:
- - zmiana_na_ujemne_obl: Iteratively adjusts positive weights without sorting.
- - zmiana_na_ujemne: Prioritizes nodes with the largest weights.
- - Selective Node Exclusion
Allows specific nodes to be excluded from transformations:
- - omijanie_dodatnich: Avoids certain nodes during positive weight normalization.
- - omijanie_ujemnych: Avoids certain nodes during negative weight normalization.

# Usage Instructions
Run the Notebook:
Execute the notebook in a Python environment that supports networkx and matplotlib.

- Graph Creation:
Call T_pqr(p, q, r) with desired parameters to generate a graph.

- Weight Assignment and Transformation:
Use nadawanie_wag to initialize weights and apply transformations like odbicie or zmiana_na_dodatnie.

- Iterative Procedures:
Apply functions like zmiana_na_dodatnie or omijanie_ujemnych to perform weight normalization or selective adjustments.

- Visualization:
Use matplotlib to visualize the final graph configuration.

# Output Highlights
