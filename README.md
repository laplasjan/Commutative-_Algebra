**grafy** contains programms used to manipulating weights of graph. After initializing **nadawanie_wag** which is a bijection between set of nodes and list of weights you can ommit nodes with positive/negative weights and applying odbicie function (means reflection) using **omijanie_dodatnich / omijanie_ujemnych**. You can also use **zmiana_na_dodatnie/ zmiana_na_ujemne** to run odbicie function (reflection) until there will be any positive/negative weights.
